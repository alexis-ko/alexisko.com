<p>A month or so later when the renovations started to slow down, and the variety of photos that I could take lessened... I looked for other things I could photograph.</p>

<p>One wintery afternoon I stumbled across an article on 'How to take indoor photos in low light'. It inspired me to shoot other subjects that I could find around the house, and one of the first things that came to mind was this overly ripe banana. What goes with bananas? Cereal of course!</p>

<p>Then I began to shoot. And that's when my food photography journey began.</p>

<p>At the time, I felt incredibly proud of myself for my cereal-banana-artistic twig composition (left image) with a sliver of light coming in from the curtains. Looking at it now, I cringe!</p>
