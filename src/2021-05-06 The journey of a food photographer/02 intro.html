<p>I recently completed <a href="https://thelittleplantation.co.uk/online-food-styling-food-photography-ecourse" target="_blank">The Little Plantation's signature food photography and food styling course</a> and it prompted me to write this blog post about growth as a food photographer.</p>

<p>I started my food photography journey back in October 2020, in the middle of lockdown. Earlier that year we bought our own flat, which meant that most of my days were filled with looking at interior Instagram accounts, scouring the web for home stuff and endlessly pinning dreamy homes on Pinterest.</p>

<p>That quickly turned into starting my own instagram account solely dedicated to photographs of our flat's interior transformation (yes I became one of those people). The image below is the first image I posted, of darling little Olaf enjoying the sun streaming into the bedroom.</p>
