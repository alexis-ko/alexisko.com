<p>Fast-forward 6 months to this week, having just submitted my final course project, I sat deflated thinking that I had so much further to go in my food photography journey. Unmotivated to keep going, being unable to battle the voices in my head that say <i>"you're not good enough"</i>, or <i>"you've barely made a dent in your progress, you have so much further to go"</i>.</p>

<p>I looked back at this very early photo and I see the journey I took. No way have I "arrived", nor do I think there's really such a thing as "arriving" to a final destination that we stop learning, stop growing, stop being open to change and doing things differently.</p>

<p>The image on the right is one I took just yesterday, out of a desperation to just <b>make something</b> in hope that it would get me out of my funk.</p>

<p>Am I out of my funk? Not quite. But I acknowledge the journey, and that it isn't over yet.</p>
