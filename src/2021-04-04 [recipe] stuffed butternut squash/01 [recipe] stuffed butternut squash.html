<h3>Mushroom and lentil stuffed butternut squash</h3>

<p>
  It may look difficult, but actually very easy and you can experiment with different combinations of spices, herbs,
  vegetables or even grains. Even scooping out the squash flesh itself works. In this version I used home grown chestnut
  mushrooms from <a

    Mushrooms</a>, and it turned out gorgeously.

  <b>Some filling ideas include:</b>

<ul>
  <li>Other or mixed mushroom varieties (shiitake, oyster etc.)</li>
  <li>Dried cranberries</li>
  <li>Walnuts</li>
  <li>Pine nuts</li>
  <li>Feta</li>
  <li>Quinoa</li>
  <li>Couscous </li>
</ul>
