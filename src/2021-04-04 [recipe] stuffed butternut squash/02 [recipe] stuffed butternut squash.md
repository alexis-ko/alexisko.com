Stuffed butternut squash

Looks difficult, but actually very easy and you can experiment with different combinations of spices, herbs, vegetables
or even grains. Even scooping out the squash flesh itself works. In this version I used home grown chestnut mushrooms
from [Merryhill
Mushrooms](https://www.merryhill-mushrooms.co.uk/store/p5/Merryhill-Mushrooms-Chestnut-mushroom-gift-kit.html), and it
turned out gorgeously.

Some ideas include:

1. Other or mixed mushroom varieties (shiitake, oyster etc.)
1. Dried cranberries
1. Walnuts
1. Pine nuts
1. Feta
1. Quinoa
1. Couscous

I donâ€™t usually cook with recipes, so here are rough amounts for these stuffed butternut squashes.
