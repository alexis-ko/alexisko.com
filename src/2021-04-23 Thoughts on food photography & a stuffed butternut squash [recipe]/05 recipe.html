<b>Cooking time</b> 1hr 30mins, may be quicker if you have a smaller-sized squash
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>For the squash</b>
<ul>
<li>1 large butternut squash</li>
<li>2 tbsp. neutral flavoured vegetable oil </li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>For the filling</b>
<ul>
<li>1 tbsp. neutral flavoured vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
<li>Half pack of <a href="https://www.quorn.co.uk/products/meat-free-mince" target="_blank">Quorn</a> mince, defrosted*</li>
<li>About 6 large chestnut mushrooms (we used the ones we grew from merry hill mushrooms), diced</li>
<li>100g cooked brown lentils* </li>
<li>Cheese of your choice, for sprinkling</li>
<li>Herbs of your choice, for sprinkling </li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Butternut squash</b>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 200°C / 400°F</li>
<li>Cut the butternut squash in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. You can keep these for roasting or discard.
</li>
<li>Season the flesh sides with oil, salt, pepper and whatever seasonings you like (i.e. cumin, rosemary, cinnamon or,
  if you’re going fancy, some smoked paprika)</li>
<li>Bake the squash cut side down on a lined baking pan, for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Flip the squash to cut-side up and bake for another 20 mins. This will depend on the size of the squash, but it should be easy to prick with a fork. </li>
</ol>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Filling</b>
<ol>
<li>Meanwhile, prepare the filling. Heat the oil large frying pan on medium heat (you could use a pot but it would mean the filling ingredients would be piled on top of one another) </li>
<li>Add the onions and sauté them until slightly soft. </li>
<li>Add the mushrooms and fry until just half cooked. They should just be starting to brown.</li>
<li>Add the Quorn mince and lentils. Continue to fry until everything is nicely coated with the oil.</li>
<li>Add salt, pepper and any other seasonings you like.</li>
<li>Set aside.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<br>
<p>
<b>Assembly</b>
<ol>
<li>Once the squash is soft, remove it from the oven and increase the oven temperature to 220°C / 428°F </li>
<li>Scoop the previously prepared filling onto the cut-side of the butternut squash. This recipe makes a lot of filling, so feel free to
  top the entire surface of the squash or save some for later.</li>
<li>Sprinkle with cheese.</li>
<li>Once the oven is preheated, bake the squash for another 5-10 minutes, just until the cheese is golden.</li>
<li>Remove the squash from the oven and sprinkle any fresh herbs if using. In the photo, I used fresh oregano. </li>
</ol>

<b>Tips</b>
<ul>
<li>Quorn mince can be also added frozen, but it obviously it will take longer to cook.</li>
<li>If using dried lentils, make sure to rinse the lentils before cooking, to remove any debris. To make 100g cooked lentils, I used 50g dried
  lentils and about 3 times the amount of water. It takes about 30 minutes or so to cook and can be done in advance or while you prepare the filling</li>
</ul>
