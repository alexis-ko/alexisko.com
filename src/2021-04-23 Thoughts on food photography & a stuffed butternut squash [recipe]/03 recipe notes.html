<p>It may look difficult, but it's actually very easy to make and you can experiment with different combinations of spices, herbs, vegetables or even grains. Even scooping out the squash flesh itself works. In this version I used <a href="https://www.quorn.co.uk/products/meat-free-mince" target="_blank">Quorn mince</a> and chestnut mushrooms for the filling, and it turned out gorgeously.

  <b>Other filling ideas include:</b>

<ul>
  <li>Other or mixed mushroom varieties (shiitake, oyster etc.)</li>
  <li>Dried cranberries</li>
  <li>Walnuts</li>
  <li>Pine nuts</li>
  <li>Feta cheese</li>
  <li>Quinoa</li>
  <li>Couscous </li>
</ul>
