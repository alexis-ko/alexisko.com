<h3>Mushroom and lentil stuffed butternut squash</h3>

<p>
There’s a stereotype that when food photographers go out to eat, they always need to snap photos of their food before actually chowing down. You know what I mean, the ones that need to update their instagram stories to let everyone know about their unicorn waffle stack?

Getting into food styling, followed by food photography, I never thought I would turn into this stereotype. Luckily for my husband, being in lockdown has meant we’ve hardly gone out to eat in the past 12 months and so he’s been able to eat his food while it was still hot!

Making this mushroom and lentil stuffed butternut squash made me realise how I have started to become the stereotype that I used to cringe at. Immediately after taking it out of the oven, I grabbed my camera, put the tray by the window and asked kindly for my husband’s patience as I took a few snaps.

In my defence, the squashes were still warm when we sat down to eat them!
