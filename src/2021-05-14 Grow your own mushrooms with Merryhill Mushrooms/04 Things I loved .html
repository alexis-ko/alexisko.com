<h3>Things I loved about Merryhill Mushrooms</h3>

<ol>
<li><b>Low daily maintenance</b><br>
All the Merryhill Mushroom kits require very little maintenance. Just spray them with water twice a day (according to the kit instructions) and you're done. I had no excuses for not having a green thumb!</li>

<li><b>Great value</b><br>
We managed to pick a massive bowl of the shiitake mushrooms from one crop that was enough to make 6 main meal portions. And it goes without being said that they were deliciously fresh too. </li>

<li><b>Clear and concise instructions</b><br>
All the mushroom kits come with very clear instructions of how to care for your mushrooms as well as helpful troubleshooting tips. (Their website also covers comprehensive troubleshooting) </li>

<li><b>Variety of mushrooms!</b><br>
Merryhill Mushrooms have a wide variety of mushroom kits you can grow at home. In addition to shiitake mushrooms, they also have both yellow and pink oyster mushrooms, chestnut mushrooms and the classic white mushroom. </li>

<li><b>Minimal sunlight requirements</b><br>
You'd think that Scotland, being known to have pretty dire amounts of sunshine, would be the last place you could grow your own vegetables indoors, right? Interestingly enough, mushrooms don't need a lot of sunlight to grow. They need low, indirect light and can't be allowed to dry out - perfect for our humid Scottish weather!</li>
