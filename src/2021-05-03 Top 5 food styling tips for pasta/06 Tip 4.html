<ol start="4"><li><b>The finger twirl technique</b><br><br>
To get that effortlessly plated yet unfussy look, take a couple of pasta strands and roughly line them up so they begin at the same place. Then loosely twirly them around two fingers (or a fork) to create a little nest. 
<br><br>
Position the little nests in the bowl/plate you’re using. I plated them in a rough circle shape to form the base layer, then I added a few more nests on top to add height and dimension. 
<br><br>
This will depend on the vessel you’re using, the sauce, and also the type of mood or style you want to create. For example if you are creating a fine dining restaurant scene, you may want to wrap your nests tighter and more neatly. Whereas if you are going for a more casual, homemade vibe, you might prefer a looser, less rigid approach. 
<br><br>
<b>Tip:</b> What about the loose ends?
Again, it’s a matter of what look you’re trying to achieve. I chose to leave my spaghetti strands how they fell, but if you want to be really fancy you can tuck them in or trim them.
