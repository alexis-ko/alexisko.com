<p>A big part of capturing a beautiful and visually interesting food photography is having strong food styling skills.

    In a recent collaboration with <a href="https://www.merryhill-mushrooms.co.uk/ target="_blank">Merryhill Mushrooms</a> I was given the chance to grow my own shiitake mushrooms from home (who would’ve thought!?). To showcase the natural beauty and freshness of the mushrooms, I decided to photograph a simple mushroom spaghetti dish with as little unnecessary extras as possible.

    Having never shot pasta before, I scoured the internet with terms like ‘pasta styling tips’ or ‘food styling pasta’ to get a general idea of how to start. I found a few articles on how to style pasta (which I’ve linked below) although most of what I learnt came from the actual shoot itself.
