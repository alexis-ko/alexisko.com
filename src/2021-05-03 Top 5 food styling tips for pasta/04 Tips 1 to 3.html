<h3>So, here are my top 5 food styling tips for pasta</h3>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> These tips are specifically referring to spaghetti or noodle-type dishes.

        <li><b>Decide on your hero</b><br>
Which part of the dish do you want to highlight? Is it the entire dish? Is it the process of enjoying the meal? Is it the ingredients?
<br><br>
Knowing what your main subject is is key to planning both how you photograph and style your scene.
        </li>
<br>
        <li><b>Do your research</b><br>
A super important <a href="https://youtu.be/PvNqlGuf5_E?t=541" target="_blank">styling tip</a> I learnt from Joanie Simon of The Bite Shot is to see how your subject behaves at room temperature. 
<br><br>
With the exception of meltable foods (that you want to capture frozen), it’s helpful to know what consistency, texture, even colours you’ll be working with you could be shooting for a significant amount of time. 
<br><br>
Pasta tends to get a bit sticky and dry when left to cool so having a water spray bottle or some (neutral) oil is handy to have on hand. </li>
<br>
<li><b>Rinse in cold water</b><br>
Immediately after cooking the pasta, rinse and/or plunge into cold water. This helps the noodles stay separated, and makes it easier to style. </li>
</ol>
