<div class="post_text">Stuffed butternut squash<br/><br/>Looks difficult, but actually very easy and you can experiment with different combinations of spices, herbs, vegetables or even grains. Even scooping out the squash flesh itself works. In this version I used home grown chestnut mushrooms from <a href="https://www.merryhill-mushrooms.co.uk/store/p5/Merryhill-Mushrooms-Chestnut-mushroom-gift-kit.html" target="_0">Merryhill Mushrooms</a>, and it turned out gorgeously. <br/><br/>Some ideas include: <br/><ul><li> Other or mixed mushroom varieties (shiitake, oyster etc.) <br/><li> Dried cranberries<br/><li> Walnuts<br/><li> Pine nuts<br/><li> Feta<br/><li> Quinoa<br/><li> Couscous<br/><br/>I don’t usually cook with recipes, so here are rough amounts for these stuffed butternut squashes. <br/><br/></div>

<div class="post_text">Serves 2 / vegetarian, can be made vegan without cheese or using vegan cheese <br/>Cooking time 1hr 30mins, may be quicker if you have a smaller-sized squash<br/><br/><b>For the squash</b><br/>1 large butternut squash<br/>2 tbsp. vegetable oil<br/><br/><b>For the filling</b><br/>1 small onion, chopped <br/>Half pack of quorn mince, defrosted*<br/>About 6 large chestnut mushrooms (we used the ones we grew from merry hill mushrooms), diced<br/>100g cooked brown lentils* <br/>Cheese of your choice, for sprinkling<br/>Herbs of your choice, for sprinkling<br/><br/><b>Butternut squash</b><br/><ol><li> Preheat the oven too 200°C / 400°F<br/><br/><li> Cut the butternut squash in half lengthwise and scoop out the seeds. You can keep these for roasting or discard.<br/><br/><li> Season the flesh sides with oil, salt, pepper and whatever seasonings you like (i.e. cumin, rosemary, cinnamon or, if you’re going fancy, some smoked paprika)<br/><br/><li> Bake the squash cut side down on a lined baking pan, for 15 minutes. <br/><br/><li> Flip the squash to cut-side up and bake for another 20 mins. It depends on your size of squash, but it should be easy to prick with a fork.<br/><br/><b>Filling</b><br/><ol><li> Meanwhile, prepare the filling. Heat a large frying pan on medium heat (you could use a pot but it means everything is piled on top of one another.) <br/><li> Heat the oil in the pan, sauté the onions until slightly soft. <br/><li> Add the mushrooms and fry until just half cooked. They should just be starting to brown<br/><li> Add the quorn mince and lentils. Continue to fry until everything is nicely coated with the oil.<br/><li> Add salt, pepper and any other seasonings you like.<br/><li> Set aside<br/><br/><b>Assembly</b><br/><ol><li> Once the squash is soft, increase the oven temperature to 220°C / 428°F <br/><li> Scoop the filling onto the cut-side of the butternut squash. This recipe makes a lot of filling, so feel free to top the entire surface of the squash or save some for later.<br/><li> Sprinkle with cheese.<br/><li> Bake the squash for 5-10 minutes, just until the cheese is golden.<br/><li> Remove the squash from the oven and sprinkle any fresh herbs if using. In the photo, I used fresh oregano. <br/><br/><b>Tips:</b><br/>* Quorn mince can be also added frozen, but it obviously it will take longer to cook. <br/>* Make sure to rinse the lentils before cooking, to remove any debris. To make 100g cooked lentils, I used 50g dried lentils and about 3 times the amount of water. It takes about 30 or so to cook. Can be done in advance or while you prepare the filling</div>
