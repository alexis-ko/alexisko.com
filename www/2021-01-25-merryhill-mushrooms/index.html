<div class="post_text">(Note: mushrooms pictured aren’t the ones referred to below) <br/><br/>Working from home during lockdown has meant that we no longer get that small talk / watering hole / banter that we used to get when we were in the office. At my workplace, the solution was to setup little clubs for people with different interests - from art, to food, books etc. <br/><br/>Happily scrolling along one day, I came across a photo of a massive bowl of mushrooms. It was mahoosive! Reading further I learnt that my colleague had grown these mushrooms at home, indoors. I was intrigued. I didn’t know you could grow your own mushrooms, let alone indoors.<br/><br/>Despite not having a green thumb, I thought it would be a fun experiment. So I immediately ordered myself a grow your own chestnut mushrooms kit, from <a href="https://www.merryhill-mushrooms.co.uk/" target="_0">Merryhill Mushrooms</a> and impatiently waited for it to arrive. <br/><br/>—<br/><br/>The kit arrived swiftly, and I got right away to following the steps to start my mushroom growing experiment. <br/><br/>The instructions were to water the mycelium and leave it covered for 8 days. After which you can remove the lid and in around 16 to 24 days, you should see your first harvest. </div>
