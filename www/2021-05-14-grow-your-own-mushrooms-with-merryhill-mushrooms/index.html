<div class="post_text"><p>In trying to live in a more sustainable and environmentally-conscious way, a topic that always comes up is growing your own produce. Being based in a big city like Edinburgh, means that most flats don't have much of a garden, which poses a challenge when trying to grow your own vegetables.</p>

<p>So as you might expect I was super excited when <a href="https://www.merryhill-mushrooms.co.uk/" target="_blank">Merryhill Mushrooms</a> reached out to me to do some food photography of recipes as well as product photography of their kits.</p> 

<p>I got two of their grow your own mushrooms kits, one for <a href="https://www.merryhill-mushrooms.co.uk/store/p8/Merryhill-Mushrooms-Shiitake-mushroom-grow-kit.html" target="_blank>shiitake mushrooms</a> and the other for <a href="https://www.merryhill-mushrooms.co.uk/store/p4/Merryhill-Mushrooms-Yellow-Oyster-Mushroom-Kit.html" target="_blank">yellow oyster mushrooms</a>, both of which are very easy to care for and pick (no excuse for not having a green thumb!).</p>

<p>I chose to make two dishes that made the mushrooms the hero ingredient and highlight the freshness and umami-ness(?) of the mushrooms. With the shiitake mushrooms I made a simple mushroom garlic spaghetti, and with the oyster mushrooms I made a vegan mushroom soup with a crispy topping.</p></div>

<div class="post_text"><h3>Things I loved about Merryhill Mushrooms</h3>

<ol>
<li><b>Low daily maintenance</b><br>
All the Merryhill Mushroom kits require very little maintenance. Just spray them with water twice a day (according to the kit instructions) and you're done. I had no excuses for not having a green thumb!</li>

<li><b>Great value</b><br>
We managed to pick a massive bowl of the shiitake mushrooms from one crop that was enough to make 6 main meal portions. And it goes without being said that they were deliciously fresh too. </li>

<li><b>Clear and concise instructions</b><br>
All the mushroom kits come with very clear instructions of how to care for your mushrooms as well as helpful troubleshooting tips. (Their website also covers comprehensive troubleshooting) </li>

<li><b>Variety of mushrooms!</b><br>
Merryhill Mushrooms have a wide variety of mushroom kits you can grow at home. In addition to shiitake mushrooms, they also have both yellow and pink oyster mushrooms, chestnut mushrooms and the classic white mushroom. </li>

<li><b>Minimal sunlight requirements</b><br>
You'd think that Scotland, being known to have pretty dire amounts of sunshine, would be the last place you could grow your own vegetables indoors, right? Interestingly enough, mushrooms don't need a lot of sunlight to grow. They need low, indirect light and can't be allowed to dry out - perfect for our humid Scottish weather!</li>
