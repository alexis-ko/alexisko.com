<div class="post_text"><p>A big part of capturing a beautiful and visually interesting food photography is having strong food styling skills. 
</p>
<p>
    The main ingredient I wanted to highlight here is these home-grown shiitake mushrooms. To showcase the natural beauty and freshness of the mushrooms, I decided to photograph a simple mushroom spaghetti dish with as little unnecessary extras as possible.
</p>
<p> 
    Having never shot pasta before, I scoured the internet with terms like ‘pasta styling tips’ or ‘food styling pasta’ to get a general idea of how to start. I found a few articles on how to style pasta (which I’ve linked below) although most of what I learnt came from the actual shoot itself. 
</p>

<div class="post_text"><h3>So, here are my top 5 food styling tips for pasta</h3>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> These tips are specifically referring to spaghetti or noodle-type dishes. 
</p><br>

<p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Decide on your hero</b><br>
Which part of the dish do you want to highlight? Is it the entire dish? Is it the process of enjoying the meal? Is it the ingredients?
<br><br>
Knowing what your main subject is is key to planning both how you photograph and style your scene.
        </li>
<br>
        <li><b>Do your research</b><br>
A super important <a href="https://youtu.be/PvNqlGuf5_E?t=541" target="_blank">styling tip</a> I learnt from Joanie Simon of The Bite Shot is to see how your subject behaves at room temperature. 
<br><br>
With the exception of meltable foods (that you want to capture frozen), it’s helpful to know what consistency, texture, even colours you’ll be working with you could be shooting for a significant amount of time. 
<br><br>
Pasta tends to get a bit sticky and dry when left to cool so having a water spray bottle or some (neutral) oil is handy to have on hand. </li>
<br>
<li><b>Rinse in cold water</b><br>
Immediately after cooking the pasta, rinse and/or plunge into cold water. This helps the noodles stay separated, and makes it easier to style. </li>
</ol>

  </figure>
<div class="post_text"><ol start="4"><li><b>The finger twirl technique</b><br>
To get that effortlessly plated yet unfussy look, take a couple of pasta strands and roughly line them up so they begin at the same place. Then loosely twirly them around two fingers (or a fork) to create a little nest. 
<br><br>
Position the little nests in the bowl/plate you’re using. I plated them in a rough circle shape to form the base layer, then I added a few more nests on top to add height and dimension. 
<br><br>
This will depend on the vessel you’re using, the sauce, and also the type of mood or style you want to create. For example if you are creating a fine dining restaurant scene, you may want to wrap your nests tighter and more neatly. Whereas if you are going for a more casual, homemade vibe, you might prefer a looser, less rigid approach. 
<br><br>
<b>Tip:</b> What about the loose ends?
Again, it’s a matter of what look you’re trying to achieve. I chose to leave my spaghetti strands how they fell, but if you want to be really fancy you can tuck them in or trim them. 
</li>

  </figure>
<div class="post_text"><ol start="5"><li><b>Consider textures</b><br>
Herbs, grated cheese, olive oil, toasted nuts or even breadcrumbs are all excellent things to have on hand when styling pasta. They’re great for adding texture and dimension to your dish.
