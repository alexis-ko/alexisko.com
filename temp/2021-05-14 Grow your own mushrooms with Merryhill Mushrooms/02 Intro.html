<p>In trying to live in a more sustainable and environmentally-conscious way, a topic that always comes up is growing your own produce. Being based in a big city like Edinburgh, means that most flats don't have much of a garden, which poses a challenge when trying to grow your own vegetables.</p>

<p>So as you might expect I was super excited when <a href="https://www.merryhill-mushrooms.co.uk/" target="_blank">Merryhill Mushrooms</a> reached out to me to do some food photography of recipes as well as product photography of their kits.</p>Â 

<p>I got two of their grow your own mushrooms kits, one for <a href="https://www.merryhill-mushrooms.co.uk/store/p8/Merryhill-Mushrooms-Shiitake-mushroom-grow-kit.html" target="_blank>shiitake mushrooms</a> and the other for <a href="https://www.merryhill-mushrooms.co.uk/store/p4/Merryhill-Mushrooms-Yellow-Oyster-Mushroom-Kit.html" target="_blank">yellow oyster mushrooms</a>, both of which are very easy to care for and pick (no excuse for not having a green thumb!).</p>

<p>I chose to make two dishes that made the mushrooms the hero ingredient and highlight the freshness and umami-ness(?) of the mushrooms. With the shiitake mushrooms I made a simple mushroom garlic spaghetti, and with the oyster mushrooms I made a vegan mushroom soup with a crispy topping.</p>
